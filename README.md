# TechEdWk01ProjectPage

first week project for bootcamp

üéØ Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.
Using css-styling and flexbox to create a webpagem including the use of position tags and z-index.

üéØ Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?

stretch goals, the "app.js" section is currently essetially defunct ass it won't properly restore original elements.
Left them in and consider it still workable but maybe imagine the buttons don't actually function

üéØ If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

implementing event listeners and make changes to the DOM via JS

(Optional)
üèπ Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission e.g.

What went really well and what could have gone better?

I enjoyed the variety of techniques I applied to various parts of the page. Not everything was necesary everywhere but little tweaks on elements such as the background blending or use of the z-index helped pull things together in a way that looked psuedo-professional. The footer appearing at the base of the first image is intentional. I wanted to implement something more complex than a basic footer and felt it worked well functioning similar to a disclaimer/cookie pop up on a traditional webpage.

implementing the JS buttons and restoring the content

Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials).

Nothing external, although help was recieved from Joe regarding css-clashes and text decoration, Manny assisted with , and Justin Tosh helped in the implementation of the image-blending.

Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment.

I had issues removing textDecoration from a specific element when combining heading tags with link tags.
Also couldn't implement a colour change for the text when clicking on the buttons. I also couldn't keep the original formatting when trying to use the click function in conjunction to dictate the content and what style the element should be displayed in. (no line break for button)

In attempting to use the hover function instead to initiate these changes it failed to register at all.

If attempting again would possibly attempt to overlay a new div on the exsisting content to display the information and then be removed after another button press.

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

wouldn't mind advice on resoring the content
