# TechEdWk01ProjectPage

first week project for bootcamp

app.js exists due to creating the repo before hearing assignment details.
That's also why it's called a project page.

What went really well and what could have gone better?

I enjoyed the variety of techniques I applied to various parts of the page. Not everything was necesary everywhere but little tweaks on elements such as the background blending or use of the z-index helped pull things together in a way that looked psuedo-professional.

Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials).
Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment.

I had issues removing textDecoration from a specific element when combining heading tags with link tags.

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
